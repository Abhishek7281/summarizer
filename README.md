n abstractive summarization application using the powerful NLP library called "txtai" and the Python web framework "Streamlit". Abstractive summarization is the process of generating a summary of a text by understanding its meaning and creating a new text that conveys the same information in a shorter form.
Our Streamlit app allows us to process both raw text and PDF files to get a summary. We'll start by exploring the features of txtai and how it can help us build NLP applications quickly and efficiently. Then, we'll dive into the implementation details of our summarization app, including how to extract the text from a PDF file, how to use txtai to generate a summary, and how to display the results in the Streamlit app.
